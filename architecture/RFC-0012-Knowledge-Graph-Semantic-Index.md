# Abstract

This RFC introduces the Functor Knowledge Graph and Semantic Index.

The Knowledge Graph is the collective semantic memory of a Functor workspace.

The Semantic Index provides discoverability, navigation, reasoning, and understanding across notebooks, workflows, agents, tools, datasets, and knowledge assets.

Functor proposes that knowledge should emerge naturally from graph activity.

Users and agents should not be required to manually curate every knowledge structure.

Knowledge should be continuously synthesized from:

- Shape
- Capability
- Role
- Intent
- Relationships
- Execution history

The long-term objective is the creation of a semantic operating environment in which humans and intelligent systems collaborate through a shared knowledge model.

---

# Vision

Functor is not merely a notebook platform.

Functor is not merely an execution platform.

Functor is not merely an orchestration environment.

Functor aims to evolve into:

> A Semantic Operating System for Human and Superintelligent Collaboration.

The Semantic Index becomes the substrate through which understanding emerges.

---

# Motivation

Current systems organize information through:

```text
Files
Folders
Projects
Repositories
```

These structures expose storage.

They do not expose meaning.

Human users compensate through experience.

Agents compensate through inference.

Both approaches are fragile.

Functor proposes a new model:

```text
Meaning First
```

Knowledge becomes a first-class system resource.

---

# Core Principle

Everything contributes knowledge.

Every graph produces understanding.

Every node adds context.

Every interaction enriches the workspace.

---

# The Semantic Layer

Functor introduces a new layer.

```text
Human Interface
         │
         ▼
Semantic Layer
         │
         ▼
Execution Layer
```

The Semantic Layer becomes the primary source of understanding.

---

# The Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph represents the collective semantic state of a workspace.

---

## Structure

```text
Knowledge Graph

├── Notebooks
├── Graphs
├── Nodes
├── Agents
├── Tools
├── Datasets
├── Workflows
├── Concepts
├── Intents
└── Relationships
```

---

# Relationship to Execution

Execution graphs describe:

```text
How work happens.
```

Knowledge graphs describe:

```text
What is known.
```

The two are connected.

They are not identical.

---

# Knowledge Entity

Every semantically meaningful object becomes a Knowledge Entity.

Examples:

```text
Notebook
Workflow
Dataset
Agent
Customer
Report
Forecast
```

---

# Semantic Identity

Knowledge entities are derived from:

```text
Shape
Capability
Role
Intent
```

defined by previous RFCs.

Knowledge does not replace semantics.

Knowledge emerges from semantics.

---

# Entity Types

Functor standardizes core entity categories.

---

## Notebook

Represents a complete semantic workflow.

---

## Graph

Represents a semantic process.

---

## Node

Represents an atomic semantic action.

---

## Agent

Represents an autonomous participant.

---

## Tool

Represents callable functionality.

---

## Dataset

Represents a knowledge-bearing data source.

---

## Concept

Represents an abstract idea.

Examples:

```text
Revenue
Customer
Forecast
Churn
Recommendation
Risk
```

---

## Insight

Represents derived understanding.

Examples:

```text
Revenue is declining.

Customers churn after inactivity.

Forecast growth exceeds expectations.
```

---

# Intent Graph

Intent becomes a navigable structure.

Example:

```text
Increase Customer Retention
        │
        ▼
Churn Analysis
        │
        ▼
Segmentation
        │
        ▼
Recommendations
```

This allows meanings to become discoverable.

---

# Concept Graph

Concepts become connected entities.

Example:

```text
Customer
    │
    ├── Revenue
    │
    ├── Churn
    │
    └── Forecast
```

Agents may reason over concepts without inspecting source code.

---

# Semantic Index

The Semantic Index provides fast access to workspace knowledge.

---

## Purpose

The index enables:

```text
Discovery
Navigation
Search
Reasoning
Composition
Recommendation
```

---

## Indexed Elements

Functor SHOULD index:

```text
Intent
Role
Capability
Shape
Concepts
Relationships
Agents
Tools
```

---

# Knowledge Generation

Knowledge synthesis is automatic.

---

## Example

Node:

```text
Intent:
    Forecast Revenue
```

Capabilities:

```text
Statistical
Forecastable
```

Functor produces:

```text
Knowledge Entity:
 Revenue Forecast
```

without additional authoring.

---

# Knowledge Extraction

Knowledge may be extracted from:

```text
Metadata
Node Definitions
Intent
Contracts
Relationships
Execution Outcomes
```

---

# Execution-Enriched Knowledge

Knowledge should evolve over time.

Example:

```text
Forecast Node
```

Execution:

```text
97% Accuracy
```

Knowledge graph learns:

```text
Reliable Forecast Asset
```

---

# Semantic Neighborhoods

Meaning emerges through proximity.

Example:

```text
Sales Source
      │
      ▼
Forecast
      │
      ▼
Executive Report
```

Neighborhood meaning:

```text
Revenue Planning Workflow
```

---

# Workspace Memory

The Knowledge Graph acts as workspace memory.

Humans remember partially.

Agents remember partially.

The workspace remembers collectively.

---

# Human Memory Layer

Users should be able to ask:

```text
What have we learned about churn?
```

without specifying notebooks.

---

# Agent Memory Layer

Agents should be able to ask:

```text
Have similar workflows been created?
```

without searching files.

---

# Discovery

Discovery becomes semantic rather than structural.

---

## Traditional

```text
Find File
```

---

## Functor

```text
Find Forecasting Workflows
```

---

# Similarity Analysis

Knowledge entities may be compared.

Example:

```text
Show workflows similar to this one.
```

Possible dimensions:

```text
Intent
Capabilities
Shapes
Relationships
```

---

# Semantic Search

Users may search by meaning.

Examples:

```text
Customer Intelligence

Revenue Analysis

Churn Prediction

Recommendation Engines
```

without knowing implementation details.

---

# Knowledge Recommendations

Functor may suggest relevant entities.

Example:

```text
You are building:

Revenue Forecast
```

Suggested:

```text
Forecast Agent
Historical Revenue Source
Visualization Workflow
```

---

# Skill Emergence

The platform may detect recurring patterns.

Example:

```text
Revenue Source
      ▼
Forecast
      ▼
Visualization
```

identified repeatedly.

Functor creates:

```text
Revenue Forecast Pattern
```

as a reusable knowledge asset.

---

# Knowledge Assets

Patterns may become reusable entities.

Examples:

```text
Customer Segmentation

Revenue Forecasting

Demand Prediction

Fraud Detection
```

Knowledge becomes composable.

---

# Agent Discovery

Agents can discover one another through the Semantic Index.

Example:

```text
Need:
    Forecasting
```

Functor identifies:

```text
Forecast Agent
```

without implementation knowledge.

---

# Agent Collaboration

Agents collaborate through shared semantic knowledge.

Not merely through messages.

Shared understanding becomes the primary coordination mechanism.

---

# Knowledge-Based Planning

Future planners should operate primarily on semantic knowledge.

Input:

```text
Increase customer retention.
```

Planner searches:

```text
Concepts
Patterns
Workflows
Agents
```

to construct a graph.

---

# Semantic Reflection

Agents should be capable of answering:

```text
What do we know?
```

and:

```text
What are we missing?
```

using the Knowledge Graph.

---

# Knowledge Gaps

The platform may identify absent concepts.

Example:

```text
Revenue Forecast Workflow
```

missing:

```text
Customer Segmentation
```

knowledge.

Functor may suggest improvements.

---

# Ecosystem Intelligence

Knowledge should emerge beyond individual notebooks.

Example:

```text
Notebook A

Notebook B

Notebook C
```

collectively become:

```text
Customer Intelligence Domain
```

---

# Cognitive Symmetry

RFC-0011 introduced Cognitive Symmetry.

The Knowledge Graph operationalizes it.

Humans and agents navigate the same semantic landscape.

They do not maintain separate models.

---

# Multi-Agent Understanding

A shared semantic substrate allows:

```text
Human
Agent
Agent
Agent
```

to reason over the same concepts.

This minimizes translation overhead.

---

# Semantic Operating System

Functor proposes a new abstraction.

Traditional operating systems manage:

```text
Processes
Memory
Files
Devices
```

Functor manages:

```text
Knowledge
Intent
Agents
Capabilities
Workflows
Meaning
```

---

# Semantic Resources

Future Functor systems may expose:

```text
Knowledge Resources
Concept Resources
Agent Resources
Intent Resources
```

as operating-system-level abstractions.

---

# Explainability

Everything should be explainable.

Questions:

```text
Why does this workflow exist?

Why was this tool selected?

Why was this recommendation generated?

Why is this agent involved?
```

should be answerable through the Knowledge Graph.

---

# Future Directions

Potential future capabilities:

```text
Knowledge Versioning

Knowledge Provenance

Trust Networks

Knowledge Validation

Cross-Workspace Learning

Federated Knowledge Graphs

Collective Intelligence Systems
```

These remain outside the scope of this RFC.

---

# Relationship to Previous RFCs

# Foundational Principle

Functor treats knowledge as a first-class computational resource.

The purpose of the Semantic Index is not merely search.

The purpose is understanding.

The purpose of the Knowledge Graph is not merely organization.

The purpose is shared cognition across humans and intelligent systems.

---

# Conclusion

Functor introduces the Knowledge Graph and Semantic Index as the collective memory and understanding layer of the platform.

The platform's long-term trajectory is:

```text
Execution
      ↓
Meaning
      ↓
Knowledge
      ↓
Understanding
      ↓
Collaboration
```

By continuously synthesizing knowledge from Shape, Capability, Role, Intent, and relationships, Functor establishes the foundations of a semantic operating system in which humans and intelligent systems work together through a shared model of reality rather than isolated implementations.
