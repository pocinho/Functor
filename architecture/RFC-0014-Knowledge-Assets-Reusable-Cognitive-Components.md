# Abstract

This RFC introduces Knowledge Assets and Reusable Cognitive Components.

A Knowledge Asset represents a reusable unit of understanding.

Unlike traditional software components, Knowledge Assets are not defined primarily by implementation.

They are defined by meaning.

Functor treats reusable understanding as a first-class artifact.

---

# Motivation

Traditional systems reuse:

```text
Code
Libraries
Functions
Classes
Templates
```

Functor additionally enables reuse of:

```text
Intent
Reasoning
Patterns
Knowledge
Workflows
Understanding
```

This enables humans and agents to collaborate through shared semantic structures.

---

# Core Principle

Knowledge should be reusable.

Understanding should be composable.

Intent should be portable.

---

# Definition

A Knowledge Asset is a semantic artifact that captures a reusable piece of understanding.

Examples:

```text
Revenue Forecast

Customer Segmentation

Fraud Detection

Recommendation Workflow

Market Research Playbook
```

---

# Knowledge Asset Structure

A Knowledge Asset consists of:

```text
Knowledge Asset

├── Identity
├── Intent
├── Concepts
├── Capabilities
├── Roles
├── Relationships
├── Constraints
└── Implementations
```

Implementation is optional.

Meaning is required.

---

# Cognitive Components

A Cognitive Component is an executable Knowledge Asset.

It combines:

```text
Knowledge
+
Reasoning
+
Execution
```

into a reusable unit.

---

# Examples

---

## Revenue Forecast Component

```text
Intent:
    Predict future revenue

Concepts:
    Revenue
    Time
    Growth

Capabilities:
    Forecastable
    Statistical
```

---

## Customer Intelligence Component

```text
Intent:
    Understand customer behavior

Concepts:
    Customer
    Revenue
    Churn

Capabilities:
    Searchable
    Analyzable
    Summarizable
```

---

# Cognitive Composition

Components may be assembled.

Example:

```text
Customer Source
        │
        ▼
Segmentation Asset
        │
        ▼
Forecast Asset
        │
        ▼
Recommendation Asset
```

The resulting graph expresses higher-order knowledge.

---

# Semantic Reuse

Assets should be reusable through semantic matching.

Users may request:

```text
Create churn analysis workflow.
```

Functor identifies compatible assets.

---

# Asset Discovery

Assets are indexed through:

```text
Intent
Role
Capability
Concept
```

Discovery becomes meaning-driven.

---

# Asset Evolution

Knowledge Assets are living entities.

As execution occurs:

```text
Knowledge Asset
        │
        ▼
Usage
        │
        ▼
Learning
        │
        ▼
Improved Asset
```

Assets accumulate knowledge over time.

---

# Human Knowledge Capture

When humans construct workflows, the resulting understanding should become reusable.

The platform should not merely save execution.

It should preserve meaning.

---

# Agent Knowledge Capture

When agents successfully solve problems, reusable assets may emerge.

Example:

```text
Repeated Solution
```

becomes:

```text
Knowledge Asset
```

---

# Cognitive Patterns

Repeated semantic structures may become Cognitive Patterns.

Examples:

```text
Research Pattern

Forecast Pattern

Recommendation Pattern

Review Pattern
```

These patterns become reusable building blocks.

---

# Asset Contracts

Knowledge Assets may define:

```text
Expected Inputs

Expected Concepts

Expected Outputs

Expected Capabilities
```

allowing validation.

---

# Cognitive Libraries

Collections of Knowledge Assets form Cognitive Libraries.

Examples:

```text
Sales Intelligence Library

Research Library

Forecasting Library

Agent Collaboration Library
```

---

# Organizational Knowledge

Knowledge Assets become a way to preserve organizational intelligence.

Instead of:

```text
Employee Knowledge
```

the organization maintains:

```text
Collective Cognitive Assets
```

---

# Agent Training

Agents may consume Knowledge Assets directly.

Rather than learning solely from documents.

Knowledge becomes operational.

---

# Asset Provenance

Every asset should record:

```text
Origin

Contributors

Agents

Evolution
```

This supports trust and explainability.

---

# Relationship to RFC-0012

RFC-0012 defines:

```text
Workspace Memory
```

RFC-0014 defines:

```text
Reusable Knowledge
```

---

# Relationship to RFC-0011

Intent provides semantic identity.

Knowledge Assets preserve semantic identity across contexts.

---

# Long-Term Vision

Functor evolves from:

```text
Notebook Platform
```

to:

```text
Knowledge Platform
```

to:

```text
Cognitive Platform
```

Knowledge Assets become the fundamental units of reusable intelligence.

---

# Foundational Principle

Software reuses implementation.

Functor reuses understanding.

This distinction enables collaboration between humans and intelligent systems through shared semantic structures rather than isolated code artifacts.

---

# Conclusion

Functor introduces Knowledge Assets and Reusable Cognitive Components as a mechanism for preserving, composing, discovering, and evolving understanding.

Knowledge becomes:

```text
Portable
Composable
Discoverable
Executable
```

allowing individuals, teams, agents, and future intelligent systems to collaborate through shared cognitive artifacts rather than isolated implementations.
