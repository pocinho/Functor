# Abstract

This RFC defines the Functor Semantic Graph Editor.

The editor is not merely a notebook editor.

The editor is not merely a graph editor.

The editor is the primary interface through which humans and intelligent systems interact with the Semantic Operating System defined by previous RFCs.

Its purpose is to make:

```text
Structure
Meaning
Intent
Knowledge
```

visible and navigable.

The Semantic Graph Editor transforms computation from a code-centric activity into a meaning-centric activity.

---

# Motivation

Traditional development environments expose:

```text
Files
Projects
Code
```

Traditional notebook environments expose:

```text
Cells
Outputs
Documents
```

Neither representation adequately exposes:

```text
Why a system exists
How knowledge flows
How understanding emerges
How agents collaborate
```

Functor therefore adopts a semantic-first editing model.

---

# Vision

The editor should allow participants to answer:

```text
What does this system do?

Why does it exist?

How does knowledge flow?

Which agents participate?

What concepts are involved?

How is meaning created?
```

without reading implementation code.

---

# Core Principle

The editor visualizes meaning.

Code is one possible projection.

Meaning is primary.

---

# Editor Philosophy

Functor adopts the following hierarchy:

```text
Intent
    ↓
Knowledge
    ↓
Graph
    ↓
Code
```

Traditional tools invert this relationship.

---

# Cognitive Workspace

Functor defines the editor as a Cognitive Workspace.

A Cognitive Workspace enables:

```text
Humans
Agents
Knowledge
Workflows
```

to operate in a shared semantic environment.

---

# Multiple Representations

A semantic graph may be projected through different views.

All views represent the same underlying semantic model.

---

# View Architecture

```text
Semantic Graph

├── Notebook View
├── Graph View
├── Intent View
├── Knowledge View
├── Agent View
├── Execution View
└── Code View
```

All views remain synchronized.

---

# Notebook View

The Notebook View provides a document-oriented projection.

Example:

```text
Introduction

Data Source

Analysis

Results
```

This view is optimized for narrative workflows.

---

# Graph View

The Graph View visualizes execution and dependencies.

Example:

```text
Source
   │
   ▼
Transform
   │
   ▼
Report
```

This view is optimized for computational understanding.

---

# Intent View

The Intent View visualizes purpose.

Example:

```text
Increase Customer Retention
           │
           ▼
Customer Segmentation
           │
           ▼
Generate Recommendations
```

Intent becomes visible independently of implementation.

---

# Knowledge View

The Knowledge View visualizes conceptual relationships.

Example:

```text
Customer
 ├─ Revenue
 ├─ Churn
 └─ Forecast
```

This view projects the Knowledge Graph.

---

# Agent View

The Agent View visualizes intelligent participants.

Example:

```text
Research Agent

Forecast Agent

Review Agent
```

and their relationships.

---

# Execution View

The Execution View visualizes runtime activity.

Example:

```text
Running

Materialized

Blocked

Failed
```

Execution is represented semantically.

---

# Code View

The Code View exposes implementation details.

Example:

```python
customers.groupby(...)
```

Code is considered an implementation surface.

Not the primary representation.

---

# The Semantic Canvas

The editor revolves around a Semantic Canvas.

The canvas displays semantic entities.

---

## Entities

Examples:

```text
Notebook
Graph
Node
Agent
Tool
Dataset
Insight
Concept
Workflow
```

The canvas displays relationships rather than files.

---

# Semantic Entities

Every visual element corresponds to a semantic entity.

Example:

```text
Customer Dataset
```

not:

```text
customer.py
```

The editor encourages semantic understanding.

---

# Semantic Zoom

Different zoom levels expose different degrees of detail.

---

## Zoom Level 1

Intent

```text
Improve Customer Retention
```

---

## Zoom Level 2

Workflow

```text
Segmentation
Recommendations
Reporting
```

---

## Zoom Level 3

Graph Structure

```text
Nodes
Edges
Dependencies
```

---

## Zoom Level 4

Implementation

```text
Python
Rust
SQL
```

Meaning appears before implementation.

---

# Semantic Layers

The editor exposes several semantic layers.

---

## Structure Layer

Derived from RFC-0004.

Displays:

```text
Nodes
Edges
Subgraphs
```

---

## Capability Layer

Derived from RFC-0005.

Displays:

```text
Queryable
Forecastable
Embeddable
Visualizable
```

---

## Role Layer

Displays:

```text
Source
Transform
Agent
Tool
Sink
```

---

## Intent Layer

Derived from RFC-0011.

Displays:

```text
Purpose
Goals
Objectives
```

---

## Knowledge Layer

Derived from RFC-0012.

Displays:

```text
Concepts
Relationships
Insights
```

---

# Notebook Authoring

Notebook editing remains supported.

Users may author content through:

```text
Notebook Pages
```

or:

```text
Graph Editing
```

Both produce equivalent graph structures.

---

# Semantic Authoring

Users should be able to author through intent.

Example:

```text
Create customer churn workflow.
```

The editor may synthesize graph structures.

---

# Agent-Assisted Construction

Agents become editing participants.

Users may request:

```text
Build forecasting workflow.
```

Agents construct draft graphs.

---

# Semantic Suggestions

Suggestions should be semantic.

Example:

```text
You added Revenue Forecast.

Recommended:
    Historical Revenue Source

Recommended:
    Forecast Visualization
```

---

# Relationship Exploration

Users should explore relationships visually.

Examples:

```text
Show upstream dependencies.

Show downstream consumers.

Show intent chain.

Show concept graph.
```

---

# Semantic Search

Search should operate on meaning.

Examples:

```text
Find churn analysis workflows.

Find forecasting agents.

Find recommendation systems.
```

Search does not require implementation knowledge.

---

# Graph Navigation

Navigation operates semantically.

Examples:

```text
Go to source.

Go to intent.

Go to capability provider.

Go to concept.
```

---

# Knowledge Navigation

Users may navigate concepts directly.

Example:

```text
Customer
    │
    ▼
Churn
    │
    ▼
Forecast
```

Knowledge becomes navigable.

---

# Intent Maps

Intent Maps visualize purpose.

Example:

```text
Corporate Objective
        │
        ▼
Customer Retention
        │
        ▼
Churn Analysis
        │
        ▼
Recommendations
```

---

# Semantic Heatmaps

Future versions may visualize:

```text
Activity
Importance
Usage
Knowledge Density
```

across the graph.

---

# Semantic Attention Paths

Derived from RFC-0011.

The editor may visualize:

```text
Why was this selected?

Why is this important?

Why does this node exist?
```

---

# Human-Agent Collaboration

The editor is designed for collaborative cognition.

Participants include:

```text
Human
Agent
Agent
Agent
```

Each participant operates upon the same semantic model.

---

# Agent Presence

Agents may appear as workspace collaborators.

Examples:

```text
Research Agent

Forecast Agent

Review Agent
```

This does not imply anthropomorphism.

Only participation.

---

# Shared Context

Humans and agents should see consistent context.

Functor introduces:

```text
Cognitive Symmetry
```

The editor operationalizes it.

---

# Workspace Awareness

The workspace should answer:

```text
What are we working on?

Why are we working on it?

What have we learned?

What remains unknown?
```

---

# Knowledge Awareness

The editor should surface:

```text
Known Concepts

Unknown Concepts

Knowledge Gaps

Emerging Patterns
```

---

# Execution Awareness

Users should understand:

```text
What executed

Why it executed

What changed

What became invalid
```

without deep runtime understanding.

---

# Explainability

Every visual element should be explainable.

Examples:

```text
Why this agent?

Why this workflow?

Why this recommendation?

Why this dependency?
```

---

# Accessibility

The semantic model should not require graph expertise.

All graph-derived information should remain accessible through:

```text
Documents
Search
Navigation
Conversation
```

and visual representations.

---

# Future Directions

Potential future capabilities include:

```text
Knowledge Playback

Timeline Navigation

Intent Evolution

Collaborative Intelligence Views

Multi-Workspace Navigation

Collective Knowledge Maps

Cognitive Load Indicators
```

These remain outside the scope of this RFC.

---

---

# Foundational Principle

The Semantic Graph Editor is not a notebook editor with graph features.

It is not a graph editor with notebook features.

It is a cognitive workspace that enables humans and intelligent systems to interact through a shared semantic model.

Meaning becomes visible.

Knowledge becomes navigable.

Understanding becomes a first-class interaction paradigm.

---

# Conclusion

Functor adopts the Semantic Graph Editor as the primary human-facing interface to the Semantic Operating System.

The editor provides multiple synchronized projections:

```text
Notebook
Graph
Intent
Knowledge
Agent
Execution
Code
```

all derived from a single semantic substrate.

By placing meaning above implementation, the editor enables a future in which humans and intelligent systems collaborate through shared understanding rather than merely shared source code.
